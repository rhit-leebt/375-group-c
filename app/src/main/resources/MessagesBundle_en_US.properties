infoalterthefuture = Privately view the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile and rearrange them in any order you’d like. Return them to the top of the Draw Pile face down, then continue with your turn.
infoattack = Immediately end your turn(s) without drawing and force the next player to take 2 turns in a row. The victim of this card takes a turn as normal (play-or-pass then draw). Then, when their first turn is over, it’s their turn again. If the victim of an Attack Card plays an Attack Card, their turns are immediately over, and the next player must take any remaining turns plus 2 more; e.g. 4 turns, then 6, and so on.
infobeardcat = These cards are powerless on their own, but if you collect any 2 matching Cat Cards, you can play them as a Pair to steal a random card from any player. They can also be used in Special Combos.
infocattermelon = These cards are powerless on their own, but if you collect any 2 matching Cat Cards, you can play them as a Pair to steal a random card from any player. They can also be used in Special Combos.
infodefuse = If you drew an Exploding Kitten, you can play this card instead of dying. Place your Defuse Card in the Discard Pile. Then take the Exploding Kitten, and without reordering or viewing the other cards, secretly put it back in the Draw Pile anywhere you’d like. Want to screw over the player right after you? Put the Kitten right on top of the deck. If you’d like, hold the deck under the table so that no one else can see where you put it. Your turn is over after playing this card.
infodrawfromthebottom = End your turn by drawing the bottom card from the Draw Pile.
infoexplodingkitten = You must show this card immediately. Unless you have a Defuse Card, you’re dead. Discard all of your cards, including the Exploding Kitten.
infofavor = Force any other player to give you 1 card from their hand. They choose which card to give you.
infoferalcat = Used as any Cat Card.
infohairypotatocat = These cards are powerless on their own, but if you collect any 2 matching Cat Cards, you can play them as a Pair to steal a random card from any player. They can also be used in Special Combos.
infonope = Stop any action except for an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse Card. Imagine that any card beneath a Nope Card never existed. You can also play a Nope on another Nope to negate it and create a Yup, and so on. You can play a Nope Card at any time before an action has begun, even if it’s not your turn. Any cards that have been noped are lost. Leave them in the Discard Pile. You can even play a Nope on a Special Combo.
inforainbowralphingcat = These cards are powerless on their own, but if you collect any 2 matching Cat Cards, you can play them as a Pair to steal a random card from any player. They can also be used in Special Combos.
infoseethefuture = Privately view the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile and put them back in the same order. Don’t show the cards to the other players.
infoshuffle = Shuffle the Draw Pile without viewing the cards until told to stop.
infoskip = Immediately end your turn without drawing a card. If you play a Skip Card in response to a Attack Card, it only ends 1 of the 2 turns. Playing 2 Skip Cards would end both turns.
infotacocat = These cards are powerless on their own, but if you collect any 2 matching Cat Cards, you can play them as a Pair to steal a random card from any player. They can also be used in Special Combos.
